# Design Brief

## Overview

This game will be a peaceful game about researching and analyzing different plants
and soils for their medical properties and combining them together to create new
medicines. At this point I don't intend for their to be a story around the game,
but I may add that in the future!

## What the player does

The general flow of the game loop may look something like this:

1. Receive a commission asking for a cure for a specific disease with certain characteristics
2. Begin analyzing available plants and soils for matching medical properties
3. Splice together X number of seeds based on your research
4. Plant seeds in the appropriate soil
5. Submit the grown plants
   1. If the plant is a good match
      1. Player will complete the commission and receive a reward
      2. Go to step 1
   2. Else
      1. Player will need to go back to step 2

## Progression:

In the beginning of the game, the player will only have access to a select few soils and plants.
After completing commissions, you will have the plants and their properties stored and available
for use in future projects. There may also be hidden objectives if you experiment and create an
extra potent medicine! Also, at first, the player will only be able to combine a certain number of traits.
As they progress though, they will be able to mix and match more and more traits. Some traits of the
flowers and soils will need to be discovered and only revealed after splicing them with the right
combination.
